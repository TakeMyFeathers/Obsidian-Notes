## Highlights
- actual (or completed) infinite; only potentially infinite collections ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhf9185hffy5ha8fzjpdyy46))
- Intuitionism rejects non-constructive existence proofs as ‚Äòtheological‚Äô and ‚Äòmetaphysical‚Äô. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhf94zx03q3bgktwhnfnddjk))
- The characteristic feature of non-constructive existence proofs is that they make essential use of the *principle of excluded third*
  or one of its equivalents, such as the principle of double negation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhf95cttg2wgm57cfjms24gf))
- Heyting Arithmetic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhf9atn96z9gk7cjgc148xrv))
    - Note: Heyting Arithmetic is a formal system that deals with arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication, but it does not include the law of excluded middle, which means that not every statement can be classified as either true or false. This system was developed by Arend Heyting in the early 20th century as a way to explore constructive mathematics, where the focus is on the process of finding a proof rather than just the existence of a proof. Heyting Arithmetic has applications in computer science, logic, and philosophy.
- syntactical translation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhf9bd26rbb9yj6dhgyz74kd))
    - Note: syntactical translation (noun as used in the sentence): t≈Çumaczenie syntaktyczne üìù
      Syntactical translation refers to the process of translating a mathematical statement or expression from one formal language to another without changing its meaning. It involves mapping the symbols, variables, and logical operations of one language to those of another language while preserving the structure and meaning of the statement. This process is essential in mathematical logic and computer science when working with different formal systems and programming languages.
- principles. If mathematical principles are successful, then, even if we are unable to obtain intuitive evidence for them, they may be regarded as probably true ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhfc3ks3f0018h5eqe7jmbny))
- According to Tait, questions of existence of mathematical entities can only be sensibly asked and reasonably answered from within (axiomatic) mathematical frameworks. If one is working in number theory, for instance, then one can ask whether there are prime numbers that have a given property. Such questions are then to be decided on purely mathematical grounds.

- Martin has developed an argument to show that multiple universes can always to a large extent be ‚Äúaccumulated‚Äù into a single universe (Martin 2001). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhfcwz8rm4gzwnxdbx1dp1j0))
- bite the bullet ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhh39c62g3zysfksaqv7y0mg))
- conundrum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhh6xpzg1nah06pp6zhpb48z))
    - Note: conundrum (noun): zagadka ü§î
      Conundrum: In this document, the term conundrum refers to the apparent contradiction between Dedekind's categoricity theorems and the fact that he did not work with first-order formalizations of the basic principles of arithmetic and analysis. The author's solution to this conundrum is that if the principles of arithmetic are formulated in a second-order language, then Dedekind's argument goes through and we have a categorical theory.
