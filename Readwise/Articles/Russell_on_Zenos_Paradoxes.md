- Document Note: Bertrand Russell is known for his promotion of the idea that modern mathematics can solve Zeno's paradoxes. However, an in-depth study of Russell's views on Zeno reveals that his solutions to the paradoxes do not live up to his claims, and he never provided a solution that meets his own conditions of adequacy. Russell's discussion of Zeno's paradoxes also reveals his changing views on space and time, and the significance of Cantorian foundations of infinity.
