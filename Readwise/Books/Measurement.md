We mathematicians don’t know how to solve our problems either. If we did, they would no longer be problems! We’re always working at the edge of the unknown, and we’re always stuck. Until we have a breakthrough. And I hope you have many—it’s an incredible feeling. But there is no special procedure for doing mathematics. You just have to think a lot and hope that inspiration comes to you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmexs8x4efgz1nkgjdc7d9gp))
    - Note: What are mathematical problems and why we solve them?

Don’t be afraid that you can’t answer your own questions—that’s the natural state of the mathematician. Also, try to always have five or six problems you are working on. It is very frustrating to keep banging your head against the same wall over and over. (It’s much better to have five or six walls to bang your head against!) Seriously, taking a break from a problem always seems to help. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmexy3s5f9fcd13avdcxd4vz))
